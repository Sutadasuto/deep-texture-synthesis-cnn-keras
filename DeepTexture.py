    This file contains a modified version of the original project,
    intended for use with Tensorflow 2 instead of Keras with Tensorflow backend.
    This code was tested with Tensorflow version 2.1.0.
    See original documentation below.

    This file contains the main class, of this project, 
    that synthesise a texture based on the provided texture.

    This Project is an implementation of following research paper:

            1505.07376,
            Author = {Leon A. Gatys and Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge},
            Title = {Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks},
            Year = {2015},
            Eprint = {1505.07376},
            Eprinttype = {arXiv},
        }
    }

    NB: I have used fchollet's style transfer project as reference for this project.
    NB: Citations are in BibLaTeX format.

    As mentioned by authors replacing MaxPooling2D layers of VGG19 with AveragePooling2D layers result in 
    good results.

    So to fulfill this I have customized the original VGG19 model written by fchollet by replacing 
    MaxPooling2D layers with AveragePooling2D layers.
